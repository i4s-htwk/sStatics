`sStatics` is a Python package for the analysis of planar truss structures 
using the displacement method. `sStatics` can be used to calculate 
displacements,  internal forces, and support reactions, and to visualise 
structural behavior under applied loads. The package supports second-order 
analysis and influence lines for advanced structural assessment.
