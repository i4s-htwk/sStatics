    "# Second Order: Iterative Approach\n",
    "This example demonstrates the iterative approach for performing a Second-Order analysis on a cantilever column.\n",
    "As in the previous example *[\"Second Order: Cantilever Colum\"](second_order_cantilever.ipynb)*, the structure is a 4 m cantilever with a HEA 240 cross-section,\n",
    "subjected to a point load at the top and a trapezoidal distributed load along its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative approach refines the equilibrium solution step by step until convergence is achieved.\n",
    "Instead of updating the element stiffness matrices directly, the equilibrium is reached by incrementally adjusting the nodal displacements and updating the system geometry in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept of the Iterative Approach\n",
    "In Second-Order theory, the system behavior depends on its deformed geometry.\n",
    "While analytic or matrix-based approaches include geometric effects directly in the stiffness matrix,\n",
    "the iterative method approximates these effects by repeatedly solving the system as the geometry changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a First-Order analysis (undeformed geometry).\n",
    "2. Compute displacements and internal forces.\n",
    "3. Update node positions based on the results.\n",
    "4. Re-solve the new system.\n",
    "5. Repeat until the change in displacements between two iterations is smaller than a defined tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative refinement gradually brings the structure into equilibrium in its deformed configuration,\n",
    "capturing geometric nonlinearities without directly modifying the stiffness matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Workflow\n",
    "The iterative process follows this workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a SecondOrder instance with the structural system.\n",
    "2. Call get_iteration_results() to start the iteration loop.\n",
    "3. Define two key parameters:\n",
    "    - Number of maximum iterations (e.g. 10)\n",
    "    - Convergence tolerance (e.g. 0.001)\n",
    "4. For each iteration:\n",
    "   - Solve the current system.\n",
    "    - Compare nodal displacements with the previous iteration.\n",
    "    - update node coordinates\n",
    "    - If the change < tolerance → stop.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, update the system and continue.\n",
    "5. Store intermediate systems and results for later inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define System\n",
    "The same cantilever system from the previous example is used here.\n",
    "It consists of a 4 m vertical cantilever column modeled with one bar, a point load at the free end, and a trapezoidal distributed load along its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define the material, cross-section, nodes, bar, and assemble them into a `System`."
