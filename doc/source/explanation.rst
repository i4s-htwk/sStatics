In this section, we will focus on the theoretical background of the solvers
used in the program. The intention is to connect the practical examples
with the methods that are applied internally to carry out the calculations.

Future explanations will introduce the **displacement method** as a starting point,
followed by further solution strategies implemented in the program.
This step-by-step approach will make it easier to understand not only the
workflow of the examples but also the reasoning behind the numerical results.
